    The EventQueue class is a collection of simulation events which will happen at a
    certain date ().
    An event can be anything that triggers a reaction within the model;
    for example, reducing the activity of an agent or restoring it are events.

    An event is defined as a pair (type, info):
    - type is a value of the EventType enumeration;
    - info is a list/tuple containing all information that the model requires to manage the event.
        Its structure and content is specific to each type of event.
