    Loads the activities per period, and builds the associated visit

    Parameters
    ----------
    period_activities_dir: str, optional. Path to the directory in which the period activities are stored, with
    a single CSV file for each period. The default value is the default location of those files after
    they are created by the prepare_data.ipynb notebook.
    Returns
    -------
    A pair LV, LA:
    -- LV is a list of Np sparse matrices, with Np being the number of periods.
    Each matrix is a matrix V such that V[f, i] is 1 if agent i visited f
    during the period, and 0 otherwise. The matrices are stored in the COO format.
    -- LA is a list of Np arrays of shape (n_agents). For a period p, an array A(p)
    is such that A(p)[i] is the index of the facility that agent i was at during period
    p. If the agent visited several facilities during p, the last one is kept.
