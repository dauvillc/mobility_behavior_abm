ClÃ©ment Dauvilliers - EPFL Transp-or - 17/01/2023
Implements functions to compute the agents' characteristics.
The characteristics are defined as functions of the agents' attributes, such
as the age, and their associated free parameters (thetas).
The characteristics have specific purposes: the impact of a given attribute
may not be the same for the recovery rate as for the level of infection. Therefore,
separate characteristics have to be defined for each purpose;

    Computes the agents' characteristic regarding the probability of infection and test.
    Parameters
    ----------
    attributes: DataFrame of shape (n_agents, n_characteristics); population characteristics. Each column
        is an attribute, such as "age".
    params: map {attribute: param_value} whose keys are the attributes to use (e.g., 'age') and
        the values are the betas (float values).

    Returns
    -------
    An array C of shape (n_agents), such that C[i] is the
    characteristic of agent i regarding their probability of infection.
