ClÃ©ment Dauvilliers - EPFL Transp-or - 17/01/2023
Implements functions to compute the agents' characteristics.
The characteristics are defined as functions of the agents' attributes, such
as the age, and their associated free parameters (thetas).
The characteristics have specific purposes: the impact of a given attribute
may not be the same for the recovery rate as for the level of infection. Therefore,
separate characteristics have to be defined for each purpose;

    Loads the population dataset, which contains for every agent ID the attributes
