Usage: python3 scripts/preprocess_matsim_data.py [--help] [--age_groups]
Parses the MATSIM activities extracted from the output XML plans file. Adds the age
of every individual alongside the activities. Processes the activities' starting and ending times
to turn them into periods (e.g., from 09:00:00 to 11:00:00).

Use the --help option to see the possible options.
